The key steps are:\n\n1. Write the system as an augmented matrix [A|b] where A is the coefficient matrix and b is the constants vector\n\n2. Use elementary row operations to convert to row echelon form:\n- Multiply a row by a non-zero scalar\n- Add a multiple of one row to another row\n- Swap rows\n\n3. Convert to reduced row echelon form by working upward to eliminate entries above the leading 1's\n\nMain advantages:\n- Systematic approach that always works for consistent systems\n- Computationally efficient \n- Can reveal if a system has no solution or infinitely many solutions\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation for the discussion? I can provide examples or go into more detail about the row operations if needed."}
