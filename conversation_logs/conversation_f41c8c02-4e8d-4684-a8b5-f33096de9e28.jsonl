It's fundamental to many fields including computer graphics, machine learning, and engineering. Key concepts include:\n\n- Matrices (rectangular arrays of numbers)\n- Vectors (quantities with magnitude and direction)\n- Linear transformations\n- Systems of linear equations\n\nNow, let's solve [[2,1],[5,3]] using Gaussian elimination:\n\nStarting matrix:\n[2 1]\n[5 3]\n\nStep 1: Multiply first row by -5/2 and add to second row to eliminate the 5:\nR2 = R2 - (5/2)R1\n\n[2  1]\n[0  0.5]\n\nThe result shows the matrix in row echelon form.\n\nTo write it as fractions:\n[2  1]\n[0  1/2]\n\nThis example illustrates basic row operations used in Gaussian elimination to convert a matrix to row echelon form. Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?"}
