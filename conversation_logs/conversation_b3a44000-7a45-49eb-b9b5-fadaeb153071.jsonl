Think of it like following a recipe where you:\n\n1. Line up your equations neatly\n2. Use addition/subtraction to eliminate variables one at a time\n3. Work your way down until you can easily solve for each variable\n\nFor example, if you have:\n2x + y = 5\nx - y = 1\n\nYou can:\n1. Solve the second equation for x: x = 1 + y\n2. Plug that into the first equation:\n2(1 + y) + y = 5\n2 + 2y + y = 5\n3y = 3\ny = 1\n\n3. Then find x by plugging back in:\nx = 1 + y = 2\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this more slowly or with a different example? Math can feel scary, but we can break it down into smaller, manageable steps."}
