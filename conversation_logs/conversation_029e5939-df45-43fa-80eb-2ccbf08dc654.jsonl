Let me help you communicate this to others constructively:\n\n\"I want to be honest - math makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable. I'd really appreciate some patience and support in working through math concepts. Could we start with the basics and build up gradually? I learn best when concepts are explained step-by-step in a clear way.\"\n\nThis expresses your feelings while staying open to learning and asking for what you need.
