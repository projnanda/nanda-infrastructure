It is an essential tool in many fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and economics.\n\nMatrix and vector algebra: Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, and vectors are one-dimensional arrays. Matrix and vector operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar multiplication, are the building blocks of linear algebra. These operations allow us to manipulate and analyze data in a systematic way.\n\nGaussian elimination: Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. It involves performing a series of row operations on a matrix to transform it into an upper triangular form, which can then be used to find the solution to the system.\n\nVector spaces: A vector space is a collection of vectors that satisfies certain properties, such as closure under addition and scalar multiplication. Vector spaces are the foundation of linear algebra and are used to study the properties of linear transformations.\n\nLinear independence: Vectors in a vector space are said to be linearly independent if none of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This concept is important in understanding the structure of vector spaces and the properties of linear transformations.\n\nEigenvectors: Eigenvectors are special vectors associated with a linear transformation or a matrix. They are vectors that are mapped to scalar multiples of themselves by the transformation or matrix. Eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues are important in many applications, such as in the analysis of dynamical systems and in the study of principal component analysis.\n\nNow, let's solve the given problem using Gaussian elimination:\n\nA = [[2, 1, -1], [-3, -1, 2], [-2, 1, 2]]\nb = [8, -11, -3]\n\nStep 1: Augment the matrix A with the vector b to form the augmented matrix [A|b].\n[A|b] = [[2, 1, -1, 8], [-3, -1, 2, -11], [-2, 1, 2, -3]]\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to transform the augmented matrix into row echelon form.\nR2 = R2 + 3R1\nR3 = R3 + 2R1\n[A|b] = [[2, 1, -1, 8], [0, 2, -1, -23], [0, 3, 0, 13]]\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the solution.\nFrom the third row, we have x3 = 13/3.\nSubstituting this into the second row, we have 2y - z = -23, so y = -23/2 + z/2.\nSubstituting these values into the first row, we have 2x + y - z = 8, so x = (8 - y + z)/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = 1\ny = -11.5\nz = 13/3"}
