It's fundamental to many fields including computer graphics, machine learning, and engineering. Key concepts include:\n\n- Matrices (rectangular arrays of numbers)\n- Vectors (special matrices with one row or column)\n- Linear transformations \n- Systems of linear equations\n\nFor the Gaussian elimination on [[2,1],[5,3]], let's solve step by step:\n\nStarting matrix:\n[2 1]\n[5 3]\n\nTo get row echelon form, we'll eliminate the 5 in the lower left:\n1. Multiply first row by -5/2 and add to second row:\n[2 1]\n[0 0.5]\n\nThe matrix is now in row echelon form:\n[2 1]\n[0 0.5]\n\nThis shows the matrix reduced using Gaussian elimination. The process helps solve systems of equations and find matrix properties like determinants.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any particular aspect of linear algebra or the elimination process?"}
