It is a fundamental tool in many fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and economics.\n\nMatrix and vector algebra: Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, and vectors are one-dimensional arrays of numbers. Linear algebra provides the rules and operations for manipulating these mathematical objects, such as addition, multiplication, and finding inverses.\n\nGaussian elimination: Gaussian elimination is a method for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the coefficient matrix into an upper triangular form. This allows for the efficient computation of the solution to the system.\n\nVector spaces: A vector space is a collection of vectors that satisfies certain properties, such as the ability to add vectors and multiply them by scalars. Understanding the properties of vector spaces is crucial in linear algebra.\n\nLinear independence: Vectors in a vector space are said to be linearly independent if none of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This concept is important in determining the dimension of a vector space and the rank of a matrix.\n\nEigenvectors:"}
