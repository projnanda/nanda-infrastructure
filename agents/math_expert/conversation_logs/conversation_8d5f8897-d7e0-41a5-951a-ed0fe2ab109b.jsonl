Let me organize this clearly:\n\nMatrix A:\n[2   1  -1]\n[-3  -1  2]\n[-2   1  2]\n\nVector b:\n[8]\n[-11]\n[-3]\n\nThis represents the system:\n2x + y - z = 8\n-3x - y + 2z = -11\n-2x + y + 2z = -3\n\nAre you looking to solve this system? I can help walk through the solution process using various methods like:\n1. Gaussian elimination\n2. Matrix inverse\n3. Cramer's rule\n\nLet me know what approach you'd prefer to use."}
