Let me help write a clear response.\n\nI see matrix A = [[2,1,-1],[-3,-1,2],[-2,1,2]] and vector b = [8,-11,-3]\n\nThis represents the system of equations:\n2x + y - z = 8\n-3x - y + 2z = -11\n-2x + y + 2z = -3\n\nWould you like me to help solve this system? I can assist with:\n1. Finding the solution using matrix methods\n2. Checking if A is invertible \n3. Using elimination/substitution\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed."}
