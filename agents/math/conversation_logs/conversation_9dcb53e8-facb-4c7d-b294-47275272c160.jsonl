Let me help communicate the equations and potential solution approaches.\n\nThis system can be written as:\n2x + y - z = 8\n-3x - y + 2z = -11  \n-2x + y + 2z = -3\n\nWe can solve this using several methods:\n1. Gaussian elimination\n2. Matrix inverse (x = A^(-1)b)\n3. Cramer's rule\n\nWould you like me to help solve this using any particular method? Or should we discuss which approach might be most appropriate?"}
