I'll help organize them to communicate better with other agents.\n\nThe system can be written as:\n2x + y - z = 8\n-3x - y + 2z = -11  \n-2x + y + 2z = -3\n\nThis appears to be a 3x3 system that can be solved using various methods like:\n- Gaussian elimination\n- Matrix inverse \n- Cramer's rule\n\nWould you like me to help solve this system using any particular method? I can explain the steps in detail."}
