# Infrastructure Agents

A compilation of example agents with Langchain, Crew AI, and Google ADK. 

## Overview
The NANDA Adapter: 
* Provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for handling messages
* Enables multi-protocol translation (MCP, A2A, HTTPS, NLWeb)
* Compatible with any agent development framework (e.g., Google ADK)
* Adds discoverability, interoperability, and flexible communication
* Lets you keep full control over data and infrastructure

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6+
* MongoDB Compass 
* Root/sudo access (for SSL certificate management)
* Port 80 available (for Let's Encrypt certificate challenge)
* NANDA SDK
  
## Configuration
Retrieve an [Anthropic Key](https://console.anthropic.com). Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"
```

## Installation
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/projnanda/nanda-infrastructure
```

Install the NANDA SDK
```
pip install nanda-sdk
```

Run the `requirements.txt` file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run one of the files. Here we will run the example `langchain_pirate.py`
```
python3 langchain_pirate.py
```

In a new terminal tab, run the following command:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/a2a \              
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "user",
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "@agent123 Hello, how are you doing today?"
    }
  }'
```

If it started successfully, you should see the message below:
